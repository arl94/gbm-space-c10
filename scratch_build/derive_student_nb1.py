"""Derive the Level 1 STUDENT notebook from the completed, executed SOLUTION notebook.

Rules (per project style guide):
- Code cells -> blank placeholder (one-line comment derived from the preceding TASK).
- Markdown TASK/QUESTION/CHECKPOINT cells: kept (they're instructions, not answers).
- HINT cells that reveal a specific computed decision/value: softened to remove the
  giveaway number while keeping the conceptual nudge.
- Strip all cell outputs (solution-only).
- Point the data path back at the REAL full-scale dataset (the solution was executed on a
  tiny demo subsample for rapid turnaround -- students get the real data).
- No paper reveal, no answer-key column names anywhere (none were present in the solution
  to begin with -- verified by construction, see build_solution_nb.py).
